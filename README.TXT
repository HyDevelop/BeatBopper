Note: You can't run this from a gfar or a jar, you have to download it
and decompress it to play, because it needs to read beatmap files from
a local directory.

## This game is...
A keyboard-based rhythm game similar to Guitar Hero, Etterna (Stepmania),
O2Jam Ultimate, FlashFlashRevolution, osu!mania, Lunatic Rave 2 (BMS),
VOEZ, Musynx, Dynamix, INVAXION, BeatMania IIDX, LoveLive, Sound Voltex,
Rhythm Master, and Malody.


This game is designed with 4 keys, and each key is corresponding with a
column of notes, specifically designed by the "mappers" to align with the 
song. The notes will fall down from the top at approperiate time, and the
player is going to hit them with the keys when they fall to the top of
the line indicating the keys. Score is given corresponding to the actual
hit time, as accurate as System.currentTimeMillis() can be, and the final
accuracy is the percentage of the notes being hit in the full score time 
window.


The main menu contains the list of songs avaliable, and they are under
the ./beatmaps/ folder under the greenfoot project folder. You can click
a song cover to see it's difficulties. Each difficulty has a number that
represents how difficult it is (Based on the density of notes).

If you want to change the speed or anything, just edit Constants.java.
